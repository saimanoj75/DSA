> What are articulation points?
   A vertex is articulation point if removing edge that is including this vertex results in disconnected graph
   And it increases connected components
>Application of Articulation point
For finding the single point of failure in a network and removing it either by adding edges or redesigning the network to make more reliable. Because we dont want network to fail due to removal of one connection.

> Tarjan's Algo can be used to find articulation points.
